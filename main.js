// Initialize a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The parameters should be playerSelection and computerSelection, and at the end it should return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock. The playerSelection parameter should be case-insensitive and a tie should cause a replay. 

// Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end. Use prompt() to get input from the user.
